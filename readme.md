# Drowsiness Detection Using OpenCV with warning Signal and Beep Sound.


## Applications 

This project can be implemented in vehicles to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. When the system detects signs of drowsiness, it can trigger a beep sound to alert the driver, ensuring they stay focused and safe on the road.

### Code Requirements 
The example code is in Python ([version 3.9](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 

### Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Description 

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

### Execution 
To run the code, type `python sample.py`

```
python sample.py
```
